### Console
 `grep -R --exclude-dir=node_modules "string" ./`
 
 Use that command to grep the whole codebase and exclude certain directories.
 
 
 ### Rails
 `safety assured` migration block is a no no. Works oppose you think.
 
 `change_column_default` apparently works after the fact? 
 
 `change_column_null` also disables columns from being initialized null?
